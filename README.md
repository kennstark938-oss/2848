# 2048 Enhanced AI Edition ðŸš€
This project is a modern, stylish web implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built with Python Flask. It features a live score display, tracking the userâ€™s progress and highest tile achieved. The game supports undoing moves and resetting the state at any time. Key enhancements include AI-powered features: the player can request hints for the best next move, or enable an auto-play mode where the AI plays the game automatically.

The user interface is designed to be clean and responsive, providing smooth tile animations and mobile-friendly controls. Players can interact using either keyboard arrow keys or on-screen buttons. Win and game-over states feature distinct visual feedback, keeping users engaged. The scoring system updates dynamically based on tile merges to track player progress accurately.

To start playing, install the Flask dependency and run the included Python script. The game launches locally in a web browser, offering an easily accessible and lightweight experience. This project can be extended with deeper AI search algorithms, custom tile themes, and online leaderboards in the future.

Contributions and feature requests are welcome. This application is open-source under the MIT License, encouraging community involvement to improve and expand its capabilities.
